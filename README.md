# PowerBI-Project
Data was collected on the number of immigrants to Canada from 1980 to 2013, along with their countries of origin. 

Data was cleaned and transformed to suit the project 

The data was analyzed to create a visualization of the total number of immigrants to Canada during the given period. 

The data was further analyzed to create separate visualizations for immigration by continent and immigration by region. 

The project also includes a comparison of the proportions of immigrants coming from developed countries versus those from developing countries. 

The visualizations were created by using various data visualization tools (PowerBI) 

The challenges of this project can be traced back to the collection of data and the cleaning of data. Some data was incomplete, which requires extensive cleaning to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.  

I concluded the project with a discussion of the findings and their implications for Canada's immigration policies. 

The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Canada's immigration patterns over a 33-year period, highlighting the changes in the number of immigrants, their countries of origin, and the proportions of immigrants from developed and developing countries. The project's visualizations will provide an easy-to-understand representation of the data, making it accessible to a wider audience. The project's findings will be useful for policymakers, researchers, and anyone interested in Canada's immigration trends.
